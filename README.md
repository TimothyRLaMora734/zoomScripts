# zoomScripts
Applescripts for adding and removing zoom.us permissions for Camera, Mic, and TODO: Screen Capture (Catalina)

Works best with FastScripts if you put in Applications Script folder for zoom.us. And assign Cmd+Q for Turn Off Zoom permissions script

TODO:

Make it dynamicly handle the row of the app for the checkbox. 
Currently, it assumes it is the second app in each of the permissions, which each user would need to modify per platform


Catalina support in the works just haven't had a chance to test it...
