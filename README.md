# zoomScripts
Applescripts for adding and removing zoom.us permissions for Camera, Mic, and TODO: Screen Capture (Catalina)

Works best with FastScripts if you put in Applications Script folder for zoom.us. And assign Cmd+Q for Turn Off Zoom permissions script

TODO:

Catalina support might work just haven't had a chance to test it...
